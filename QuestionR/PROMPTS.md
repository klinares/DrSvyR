# Prompts for Claude Code

Paste one prompt per session, from the repository root (`D:\repos\DrSvyR`).
Each ends at a review gate: bring `QuestionR/REVIEW.md` and
`QuestionR/STATUS.md` back to the Claude project before the next one. Later
prompts are added here after each review.

## Phases 0 and 1: scaffold, skills loader, prompt assembly

```
Read CLAUDE.md, then QuestionR/DESIGN.md, QuestionR/STATUS.md,
QuestionR/www/skills/README.md and QuestionR/tests/review.R. Read
svysegment/app.R, svysegment/R/llm.R, svysegment/R/ai_reflexes.R and
office_logo() in svysegment/R/ui_help.R for the patterns DESIGN.md section 3
says to copy.

Create branch questionr from main. Do Phase 0, then Phase 1, exactly as
DESIGN.md section 10 defines them. Then stop.

Rules:
- The root CLAUDE.md hard rules apply. No for or while loops, native pipe
  only, R/ holds function definitions and constants only.
- Do not edit anything in QuestionR/www/skills/. It is checksummed.
- Do not change what QuestionR/tests/review.R checks. If it has a bug, fix
  only the bug and report the diff in STATUS.md.
- skills.R must define build_prompt(form) and build_checklist(form) exactly
  as the contract in DESIGN.md section 5 says, including the form field
  names and the PREPARE labels.
- No model calls in these two phases. Do not write llm.R beyond what Phase 0
  needs for the key box.
- Do not invent package functions or arguments. Check installed help. Record
  each VERIFY you resolve in STATUS.md with the function and arguments found.
- Never weaken a test to make it pass. If something in DESIGN.md or the
  skills cannot be done as written, stop and say so in STATUS.md.

After each phase, from inside QuestionR/ in PowerShell:
  & "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.6.1/bin/Rscript.exe" --no-init-file tests/smoke.R
  & "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.6.1/bin/Rscript.exe" --no-init-file tests/review.R <phase>
Fix what fails in your own code and rerun until REVIEW.md shows no FAIL that
you can fix. Leave any FAIL you cannot fix visible and explain it.

Commit once per phase, REVIEW.md included. Do not push.

Finish by updating STATUS.md: what was built, decisions taken and their
defaults, anything skipped, stubbed or hard-coded, anything that surprised
you, and every remaining FAIL in REVIEW.md with its cause. Then stop and
tell me to take REVIEW.md and STATUS.md to the Claude project.
